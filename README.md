## Context

 Hi and welcome to this code challenge. We created in order to test your frontend abilities.
 
 In this repo you'll find a basic node js app. 
 
 It serves the frontend app in `./www` on `localhost:5000/`
  
 It serves also 2 endpoints returning json
 
    - [GET] `/api/recipients`  => list of recipients
    - [GET] `/api/recipients/:id` => Single recipient by id 
 
 Included libraries:
 
    Frontend:
        - Angular
        - Angular UI router
        - Material light form getmdl.io
        
    Backend:    
        - Node 5.X
        - Express 4.X
